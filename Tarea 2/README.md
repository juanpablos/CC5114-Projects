===========================

Implementation of a recurrent neural network to predict some metrics in git respositories.
Comparison with a vanilla neural network to see which performs better.

To run the network, the following libraries are needed:

* Numpy

For git metrics the following git commands were used:

* git log --name-status
* git log --shortstat (--stat also works but is a bigger file)
